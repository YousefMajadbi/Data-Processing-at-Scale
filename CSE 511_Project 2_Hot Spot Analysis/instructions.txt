Hot zone analysis:
○ Input is a set of rectangles and set of points => aim finding the hotness zone/cell based
on the number of points in each rectangle.
○ Function ST-Contains
■ Input 2 strings
● Corner (opposite) points of the rectangle
● point
○ Whether the point is in the rectangle or not?
○ You need to modify the below-highlighted file to write the function ST-Contains.
○ Then Open:
○ You need to add .coalesce(1) to the last query and this function merges all the partitions
into a single partition and returns the output
Create a jar file:
1. Once you finish your function in Scala, you need to create the jar file and then test it.
2. Go to the main root of the template:
○ Open the command line:
■ cd <your path to the project folder>
■ sbt assembly (takes some time to create a jar file)
■ You will find the jar file inside the target folder
Test your code
1. After creating the jar file, you need to test it.
2. Input test cases will be in the following folder: <your template folder path>\testcase\hotzone
3. You need to write the following:
spark-submit
target\scala-<version>\CSE512-Hotspot-Analysis-Template-assembly-0.1.
0.jar test\output hotzoneanalysis src\resources\point-hotzone.csv
src\resources\zone-hotzone.csv
4. If everything is correct, you will see the output in the below path.
5. Its content must be the same as the output (hot zone-example-answer) as we have in the
template:
6. Done!!
For Hot Cell Analysis:
1. After applying changes in “HotcellAnalysis.scala and HotcellUtils.scala”
2. Then make a jar file using sbt assembly
3. Before testing the jar file,
a. We also need to download the point data
i. Download CSE 511_Hot Spot Analysis Project_yellow_trip_sample_100000.zip
ii. Unzip and extract CSE 511_Hot Spot Analysis
Project_yellow_trip_sample_100000.csv file.
b. Paste the .csv file in the following path: <your project template folder
path>\src\resources
4. The test input data will be in the following path: <your project template folder
path>\testcase\hotcell\hotcell-example-input
5. You need to write the following command
spark-submit
target\scala-<version>\CSE512-Hotspot-Analysis-Template-assembly-0.1.
0.jar test\output hotcellanalysis
src\resources\yellow_trip_sample_100000.csv
6. If everything is correct, you will see the output in the below path.
7. Done
